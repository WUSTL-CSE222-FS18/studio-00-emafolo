# Studio 0

## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

Response: I have noticed that it uses some features such as adding colors to the text and setting the text in a italic mode.


### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

***Q2. Create your list here:***
1. Rice:
  * Water
  * Salt
2. Avocado
  * Iron
  * Fat
3. Beef
4. Chiken
5. Beans

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

## My Heading

### Code

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***
```Java
  for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    System.out.println (i);
  }
```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

1. It is amazing to see tha babies activities can be tracked in a very appropriate way knowing that she/he distant from you.
2. It s great feeling knowing that you can heat/cool your house manually. You will then have to come in with a good temperature set.
3. Knowing where to park especially in big cities is pretty hard, yet with some IoT mechanis it makes it sound like a easy task.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***

| Name | Explanation|
|:----:|:----------:|
| Baby | too good to have all this for the safety of the baby|
| Home Security| This is too good to have all those features.|
| Parking | Finding a parking this easy is amazing|
| Keep Streets Clean| The world will never be durty again :) |
| Hospital Security| This is pretty much the same with Home Security|
| Self Driving Cars| World Changing Situation. Has a lot to do with AI though|

Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.

***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***
1. Hospital Security
  * https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/feature/Healthcare-IoT-security-issues-Risks-and-what-to-do-about-them
  * Already said in abouve artice.
  * They are using almost the same feature in term of building accessability.
2. Self Deiving car.
  * https://jalopnik.com/googles-self-driving-cars-have-trouble-with-basic-drivi-1828653280
  * Car won't need an havy humy help to drive.
  * Not much of a difference

## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***
##### I did not get this far

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
##### I did not get this far while in Clas.
